# VBlocks

VBlocks is a browser-based block game. The project can be packaged as a mobile app using Capacitor.

## Building JS bundles

Each game mode (`classic`, `challenge` and `infini`) loads a `bundle.js` file that is not tracked in the repository. The bundles are generated by the Node script `scripts/build-bundles.js`.

Run the following command whenever the JavaScript sources change and before serving the HTML pages:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create `bundle.js` in each mode's folder so the pages can load correctly.

## Capacitor usage

All initialization scripts listen for the `deviceready` event so they run correctly when the app is built with Capacitor. No additional plugins are required; the default Capacitor runtime handles the event.

### Basic steps

1. Install dependencies and initialize Capacitor:
   ```bash
   npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli
   npx cap init vblocks com.example.vblocks
   ```
2. Add a platform (e.g. Android):
   ```bash
   npx cap add android
   ```
3. Build the web assets and copy them:
   ```bash
   npx cap copy
   ```
4. Open the native project:
   ```bash
   npx cap open android
   ```

Make sure all assets (images, sounds, fonts) are stored locally since external URLs are avoided.
